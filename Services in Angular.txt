Services in Angular are singleton objects that provide specific functionality throughout your application. They're a fundamental building block for sharing data, logic, and external communications between components.

Key Characteristics of Angular Services
Singleton: Only one instance exists per injector

Injectable: Can be injected into components, directives, pipes, and other services

Reusable: Centralize common functionality to avoid code duplication

Creating a Service
You can create a service using the Angular CLI:

bash
ng generate service service-name
Or manually:

typescript
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root' // Makes it available application-wide
})
export class DataService {
  constructor() { }

  // Service methods
  getData() {
    return ['item1', 'item2', 'item3'];
  }
}
Registering Services
There are three ways to provide services:

Root level (recommended for most cases):

typescript
@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
Module level:

typescript
@NgModule({
  providers: [MyService],
})
Component level (creates a new instance for each component):

typescript
@Component({
  providers: [MyService]
})
Injecting Services
Services are injected via dependency injection:

typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { DataService } from './data.service';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-example',
  template: `...`
})
export class ExampleComponent {
  constructor(private dataService: DataService) { }

  items = this.dataService.getData();
}
Common Use Cases for Services
Data sharing between components

API communication (HTTP requests)

State management

Logging services

Authentication/authorization

Business logic encapsulation
