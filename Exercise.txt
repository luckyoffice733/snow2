A simple exercise for understanding Angular Reactive Forms could involve building a basic 
contact form with fields for 
first name, last name, email, and phone number. 
This form would then be able to display the entered data on submit. 

The key is to define the form structure using FormGroup, FormControl, and to bind the template to these controls. 

Note
====
create a component -> named as  -> contact

validations:
------------
first name and last name is required,minlength should be 6 characters

email ==> required,email

phone number ==>requires, validate the phoneNumber it must contain 10 digits


Display:
=========
Display the errors message in red color
and if form is not valid disabled the submit button:

if form is valid display the details,
FirstName
lastName
email
phoneNumber on the template
